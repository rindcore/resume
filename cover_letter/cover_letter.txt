Dear Sir/Madam:

I would like to apply for the position of 'Linux Engineer' which you advertised in 
'http://www.seek.com.au'. I believe my several years of technical experience 
and professional training qualify me for the position.

I have ten years experience in software development and system
administration under Linux/Unix and Windows. One of my strong points is an
ability to perform tasks correctly and efficiently in a limited time.
I enjoy working with others and can get along with all kinds of people.
I believe I will be a great help to your organization.

A permanent resident Australian visa has been granted to me in February 2010.
However, I am currently in Shanghai and will continue working for Shanghai 
American School until 30 July 2010. I will arrive in Melbourne on 8 August 2010 
and before that date I am available for a phone, conference call or conference 
chat interview, or a face-to-face will be suitable when I am in Melbourne.
All my contact information is in the resume attached by the mail.

I would appreciate it if you would give me the opportunity to interview with you 
in the near future. Thank you for your attention to my resume.

Sincerely yours,

Warren Young
